GET /ping
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/ping
    A status message "Server is up!" is returned.

POST /addItem
    Due to the design of my system, there is no need to distinguish Food and Drink.
    My serialization knows how to handle both, and the type is expressed in a field of a Consumable.
    The body represents one serialized Consumable item.
    This can be performed as follows, with words enclosed in [] indicating that some user input should be here:
        curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"[weight/volume]\":[double],\"name\":\"[String]\",\"notes\":\"[String]\",\"price\":[double],\"expDate\":\"2021-11-03T01:30[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM]\",\"daysUntilExp\":[int],\"isExpired\":[boolean],\"type\":\"[food/drink]\",\"uuid\":\"[String]\"}" localhost:8080/addItem

    Note the following:
        -if "type" is "food", then the first field should be "weight."
        =if "type" is "drink", then the first field should be "volume".
        -the name should not be empty.
        -numerical values other than "daysUntilExp" should be non-negative.
        -the time is represented in 24-hour time, for example, 23:30.
        -the "uuid" is automatically generated in the constructor; check data.json to find the id of any item.

    This command was not intended for manual use, since the object is serialized by the client.
    Check all fields carefully.

POST /removeItem
    The body represents the id of an item to be removed.
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "[String]" localhost:8080/removeConsumable

    The id is automatically generated in the constructor; check data.json to find the id of any item.

GET /listAll
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/listAll
    A serialized list of all items is returned.

GET /listExpired
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/listExpired
    A serialized list of all expired items is returned.

GET /listNonExpired
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/listNonExpired
    A serialized list of all non-expired items is returned.

GET /listExpiringIn7Days
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/listExpiringIn7Days
    A serialized list of all items expiring within seven days is returned.

GET /load
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/load
    This triggers the load operation; data.json is deserialized and loaded into the server.

GET /exit
    This can be performed as follows:
        curl -i -X GET localhost:8080/exit
    This triggers the save operation; the item list is serialized and saved into data.json.
